This project is designed to facilitate a book exchange.

The general idea of a book exchange is essentially a method to get exciting new books from family and friends. 
The idea is that many different participants mail one of their favorite books to a central person. 
The central person then shuffles all the books and mails the books to new people. 
This program should facilitate that process.
